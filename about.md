I am a Post-doctoral Research Associate at the Institute of Political Science, University of Luxembourg working on a project titled “ELWar – Electoral Legacies of War: Political Competition in Postwar Southeast Europe” funded by the ERC Starting Grant

### More Information

Prior to joining the University of Luxembourg in October 2017, I was a Visiting Fulbright Scholar at the Department of Political Science, Yale University (2017), a Cvachovec Fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto (2017), and a Research Fellow at the International Institute of Political Science, Masaryk University (2012-2017). My research focuses on the existing challenges to democracy in Central and Eastern Europe with a special emphasis on election-related conflicts, political violence, and modern forms of authoritarian rule. I am the author of Electoral Violence in the Western Balkans. From Voting to Fighting and Back (Routledge; 2017) and a co-author of Challenges to Democracies in East Central Europe (Routledge; 2016). My papers on electoral violence and democratization have been published in a variety of international peer-reviewed journals (e.g. Terrorism and Political Violence, Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, Problems of Post-Communism, Journal of International Relations and Development, Nations & Nationalism, Southeast European and Black Sea Studies, Democracy and Security, or World Political Science).
